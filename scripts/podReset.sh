# DESCRIPTION: This script is used to reset the CocoaPods dependencies for the Work tracker project.
# It checks if the script is being run from the project root directory and then performs
# a soft or hard reset based on the argument passed to the script.
# The soft reset removes the Pods directory, podfile.lock, work_tracker.xcworkspace, and the build directory.
# The hard reset additionally removes the CocoaPods cache and the Xcode derived data.
# Finally, it deintegrates the existing pods, sets up the pod environment, and installs the new pods.
# The script should be executed from the project root directory.
# Usage: ./podReset.sh [soft|hard]
# Example: ./podReset.sh soft
